## Favourite Games
* **Dota**. It's a complex, heavily strategy based MOBA with some cool mechanics. I don't play it anymore but I love to watch other people play. 
* **Pokemon**. I used to play Pokemon ROM hacks. I also made one myself..
* **Minecraft**. The possibility to build anything in a procedural world. Even though I love this game I don't play it anymore because it gives me vertigo that lasts for hours.
* **No Man's Sky**. A universe where you can explore and discover infinite beautiful unique worlds with their own unique flora and fauna. This game is THE game that I want to play every day but unfortunately my old laptop can't run it anymore.
