{{ img(path="@/blog/Writing garbage everyday/trash.png", class="graphik") }} Reading people's blogs, of all kinds, on the internet has inspired me to build my own digital space and put my own thougths on it. I have a lot of ideas in my head about different kinds of things I want to document and opinions I want to jot down, but whenever I actually start to write, I can't seem to find the right words and sentences to express what I'm thinking. I'm not a writer and I've also always had a problem trying to convert my thoughts into words which was really frustrating.
After reading a bit on the web and seeing what other people do, I've finally decided that I'm just going to type whatever comes to my head and store it in my notes app. Almost all of it will be garbage, but if I feel like one of them is good enough, then I will put it in my digital space [^1] [^2]. 

So this is the first day of me starting a routine of writing at least one paragraph or page per day, and this paragraph feels like its good enough to store in my public website.
