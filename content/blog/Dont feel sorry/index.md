{{ img(path="@/blog/dont feel sorry/sad.png", class="graphik") }} No matter what struggle you're going through, resist the urge to feel self-pity. Every time you dwell on and feel bad about what you're going through, you push yourself deeper into the abyss of despair. You might not be able to control <!-- the mental issues afflicting your mind or --> the hardships you're facing but you can control whether you feel sorry for yourself or not. Self-pity is the voice that tells you that you will never be able to overcome and is also the thing that prevents you from ever trying to.

There was a difficult phase in my life before I went to college. Life was hard because of school pressure and other things. It made me depressed and self-pity was how I dealt with it. Years after, I realised that the thing that I was using to cope with my hardships was the thing that was not only making everything worse but creating more problems for me.\
``` 
If you're a Christian remember that 
self-pity is the opposite of trusting God.
