Some social media platforms have a feature to filter out posts that contain certain keywords. Here are some of the ways I think they can improve it:

### Mute related words
An option to mute not just a specific keyword but a couple of words directly related to it.
   
  > "Sports" will mute posts containing "Football", "Tennis", etc.

  > Enabling this option will show a few words that are related to this keyword and we can select what we want to include in the muted list of words.
	
### Mute profiles with words
An option to filter out posts from profiles with certain keywords in their names and bios. 
> "crypto" will mute posts from people with "crypto" in their names and bios.

### Exclude accounts from a filter
An option to exclude accounts from a keyword(s) filter mute.
 > Mute "Taylor Swift" and add the official account of Taylor Swift as an exceptions so that this account's posts with the muted keywords won't be filtered.

### Filters for only specific accounts
An option to select only specific accounts that will be affected by a keyword(s) mute

> Mute "football" for CNN, BBC

> Will filter out posts from those accounts containing "football"


### Whitelist posts with keywords
An option to whitelist instead of blacklist posts with certain words. The whitelisted words will be used to prioritise posts with these keywords.

### Mute words in Trending
An option to not only filter posts but also prevent the trending page from showing words and hashtags with the muted keywords.  

### Mute images
An option to mute images too
> "bulbasaur" will filter out not just posts but images of this *battle salad*
 
### Wildcards or regex
> "backr\*ms" will mute "backrooms", "backr00ms", "backr\_o\_o\_ms", etc

> "\*j\*l\*o" will mute \
> "░J░L░O ░I░N░ ░B░I░O░"

### Filter list backup.
An option to export and import a list of muted keywords so we don't have to setup the same filters on another account.

<!--
### AI powered mute
Example: Pick a topic and 
  
> Topic: **Pokemon**\
> Specification:"bug types"\
> Mutes posts that contain the names of this miserable pokemon type.
   
 > Topic: **Football**\
 > Specification: "player names"\
 > Mutes posts containing football player names.
          
 > Topic: **News**
 > Specification: "Australia", "watermelons from Britain"\
 > Mutes posts from news pages that are about Australia or watermelons from Britain.
This one is a wild suggestion that is probably hard to implement and can cause way too many issues.
