I built this website because I wanted my own personal space on the internet, <!-- free from social media algorithms, rules and restrictions,--> a place I can share and store every useful and non-useful piece of personal and non-personal idea, thought, image, link, etc. 

I used a static site generator called [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). I started from a theme called [Papaya](https://justintennant.me/papaya/) which was the base of this site and ended up modifying and tweaking the entire design and structure of my website until it was completely different from the base theme.

Styling the website took more than a week but it was fun and challenging since I only had a basic idea of CSS. I didn't like the initial design that I finished, so I had to redo it a bit. I'm happy with how it looks now but I'm still going to be making a few tweaks every now and then. The hardest part was actually creating the structure of my website especially the "Garden" section since I have zero experience with templating languages, but thanks to bits of code from several parts of the base theme and using Copilot AI I was able to do it.

After finishing the coding, testing the site locally and being satisfied with the almost final design and structure, I moved all the content from my old blog and finally generated the website, which was almost instant, thanks to Zola's speed.

**Hosting**: I used [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to host the website, which is free and also provides a free ".pages.dev" custom domain.

**Banner**: The banner was AI generated with ideogram.ai and expanded with fusionbrain.

**Graphics**: The favicon and various other graphics were taken from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/), from the icon and sticker packs made by [Darius Dan](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/darius-dan)

Still not done:
- The website doesn't look nice on wide screens (desktop).
- The CSS is a mess and needs cleanup.
- Make a mascot for my website. (like the Gopher for Golang).
- The *Garden* section design is still not completely finished.
- Find a better background for the body.
- Support dark theming.
- Implement a "Like" button.
- Implement analytics just to see how many people visit the site (It won't show who)
- ....
