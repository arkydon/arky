{{ img(path="@/blog/How I made this website/repair.png", class="graphik") }} I made this website because I wanted a personal space on the web where I can share and store every useful and non-useful, personal and non-personal piece of information.

I used a *static site generator* called [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). This is a tiny ~25MB single binary (exe) tool. The structure of the website was writen with a templating language called Tera.

I had already made a website using a custom theme as the base which I modified and tweaked until the entire design and structure was completely different from the base theme. The problem was that the whole codebase was a mess - terrible CSS, confusing variable names, lots of repeated code and also a lot of code that I didn't need or had no idea what they did. There was also many parts of the website that I didnt understand how they worked. 

I decided to make the entire website again from scratch without using any theme as the base. Thanks to the internet, the docs and Copilot, Meta, Gemini and Claude I was able to make a new website. Making the structure of the website took only a few days but styling it took more than a week because I only have a basic idea of CSS. 
> Choosing the colours to choose and what made it more dificult than it should be is that the colours looks completely different on my laptop screen compared to my phone. 

I finally settled on the current design but still making a few tweaks here and there. I moved all the content from my old blog and generated the entire website, which was almost instant, thanks to Zola's speed.

**Hosting**: The website is hosted in [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), which is free and also provides a free ".pages.dev" custom domain.

**Graphics**: The favicon and various graphics were taken from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/), from the icon and sticker packs made by [Darius Dan](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/darius-dan)

 Planned: 
- Fix how it looks on widescreens. 
- Compress and convert all the images to webp.
- Make a mascot for the website.
- Tweak dark mode.
- Implement more *markdown shortcodes*.


*[Edited: Dec 2024]*

Completely redid the design of the website again. Completely changed the header, and decided to pick a simple and basic colour scheme.
