{{ img(path="@/blog/How I made this website/repair.png", class="graphik") }} I made this website because I wanted a personal space on the web where I can share and store every useful and non-useful, personal and non-personal piece of information.

I used a *static site generator* called [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) - a tiny ~25MB single binary (exe) tool. The structure of the website was writen with a templating language called Tera.

I had already made a website using a custom theme as the base which I modified until I finished making an initial final version of my website ðŸ¤·. The problem was that the code was a mess - terrible CSS code, confusing random variable names everywhere, lots of repeated code and also a lot of templating code that I didn't need or had no idea what they did. There was also many parts of the website that I didnt understand how they worked. 

I decided to make the entire website again from scratch without using any theme as the base. Thanks to the internet, the docs and Copilot, Meta, Gemini and Claude I was able to slowly make a new website. Making the structure of the website took only a few days but styling it took longer because I only have a basic idea of CSS. 
> Choosing the right colours was such a chore because the colours looks completely different compared to how they looked on my phone. 

I finally finished a design I liked which I thought was going to be the final design but I've changed the design more than a dozen times since them. 
Generating the website from the code was almost instant, thanks to Zola's speed.

**Hosting**: The website is hosted in [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), which is free and also provides a free ".pages.dev" custom domain.

**Graphics**: The favicon and various graphic icons were taken from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/), from the icon and sticker packs made by [Darius Dan](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/darius-dan)

**Fonts**: Acumin Pro

 Planned: 
- Fix how it looks on widescreens. 
- Compress and convert all the images to webp.
- Make a mascot for the website.
- Tweak dark mode.
- Implement more *markdown shortcodes*.


*[Edited: Dec 2024]*

Completely redid the design of the website again ðŸ¤·. 
Changed the header, and decided to pick a simple and basic colour scheme.
Chnaged the fonts.
