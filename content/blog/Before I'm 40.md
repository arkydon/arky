**Inspired by this [blog article](https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/30-things-before-im-thirty/) I wrote a list of the top things I want to do and see before I'm 40**

1. See the aurora borealis.\
	I would love to see them from Shillong and that is something that can possibly happen but if it does then we could be in big trouble [screwed](https://www.space.com/the-carrington-event).

2. Find another fossil.

3. Fall in love. (yeah right)

4. Have a collection of cool rocks.

5. Learn to draw and make silly drawings and space fantasy art. I scribbled something silly and sent it [here](https://guestbook.goodenough.us/) and realized how fun it was even if I was not good at it.

6. Write at least a 100 blog posts. 

7. See another spectacular meteor shower like the one I saw in [2012](https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=13&month=08&year=2012).

9. Have a reunion with all my friends from college.

10. Make a new close friend.

11.
