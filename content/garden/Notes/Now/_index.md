#### Currently
* I just finished building and designing my website using Zola and migrating all my blog content from my old site.
* Blog things: 
    - Writing blog articles. Not good at this but I'm learning.
    - Reading and being inspired by many types of blogs from the web.

* Mind Map \
    Mind maps didn't sound useful to me, it seemed like just a fancy way to do what you can do just by jotting down traditional notes. But recently I've slowly begun to understand how superior mind maps are. Right now I use an app called Nicemind to make maps to organise my ideas of how I want to structure my personal website. 

#### On pause

* Setting up my new bear blog.

* Learning Golang. Relearning programming after more than a decade.

* Being more active on Mastodon, Pixelfed and Lemmy.

#### Planning

* I think I'll make another Pok√©mon ROM hack.
