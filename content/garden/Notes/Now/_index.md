#### Currently
* Finished making my website and migrating all the articles from my old blog.
* Blog things: 
    - Learning how to write blog articles.
    - Reading and being inspired by other people's blogs.

* Playing with mind maps \
    Mind maps always seemed like just a fancy way to do what I can already do by writing ordinary notes. But now I'm starting to undertand how useful mind maps are. 
	(I used an app called Nicemind to visualise how I want the structure of my website to be.)
	
* Being more active on the fediverse: Mastodon, Pixelfed and Lemmy.

#### On pause

* Updating my old blog.
* Learning Golang for fun.

#### Planning

* Make another Pok√©mon ROM hack.
* Python again.
