**Currently**

- Playing Pokemon Black Pearl Emerald.
- Redesigning and tweaking my website.
- Listening to Christmas songs.

**Planning**

- Javascript
- Pokemon ROM hack
- Reading new book
- 

**Finished**

- Setting up a new SSD as my primary drive. Windows 11 is sluggish asf on an HDD.
- Switching to Microsoft Edge + uBo lite on Android. Kiwi hadn't been updated in a long time and Edge supports extentions now which makes it the perfect replacement.
- Switching and migrating all my notes from Notion to Upnote. Notion was becoming too sow and laggy.

**Paused**

- Dota
-
