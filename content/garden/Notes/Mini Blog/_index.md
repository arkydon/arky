### Random
I have a *'There's something seriously wrong in my head'* realisation a couple of times a day.

That sad moment when you find something very funny but can't share it with anyone because no one will get it. It's either an obscure reference that requires being chronically online to understand, or a topic that none of your friends are interested in, like Pok√©mon.
