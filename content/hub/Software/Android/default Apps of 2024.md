## Default apps of 2024

- Browser: Moved from **Kiwi** to **Microsoft Edge** because development of Kiwi seems to have stalled. Edge was a perfect replacement because extensions are now supported which is the primary reason why I was using Kiwi. I'm already using Edge on Windows, which is great because I can sync open tabs from mobile to desktop and it has this useful feature called Drop which lets me quickly send files and text, from mobile to desktop and vice versa.

- Notes: Switched from **Notion** to **Upnote**. I stopped using Notion because it has become too laggy. Although I love Upnote because it has every feature I need in a note app - notebooks, markdown and its fast, I have to switch to another app because I only recently found out the free version has a limit on the number of notes you can create.

- Weather: I used to use **Weather Timeline** and it has a really great UI and useful features but it was abandoned. I've moved to **Today Weather** which is almost as perfect as Weather Timeline. I'm using the premium version through a code that I got for free from the devs.

- Gallery: I'm using two Gallery Apps - **Fossify** and **FStop**. Both are good because they're fast and supports displaying a folder grid home view. Fossify I'm keeping because it's ad free and it plays videos almost without any problems on my trash phone. FStop I'm using because, for some reason, it's the only gallery that shows videos when I want to upload vids to whatsapp. The other reason is that on Fossify I've hidden all the meme albums and I so use FStop for memes. 
tldr: when I need to upload videos to whatsapp I use FStop, when I want to upload images I use Fossify, when I want to send or save memes I use FStop.

- **Youtube Music** for Music streaming. It comes free with Youtube Premium and I like it but I'd switch to **Spotify** if I had to choose between these two.

- **Honista IG Mod**: Switched to this Instagram mod because the previous. **MyInsta** mod hasn't been updated in a long time but I need to find a better alternative because the Honista dev added his own ads to the app which is a huge red flag.
