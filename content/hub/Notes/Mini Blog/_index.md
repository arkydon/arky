### Random
I have a *'There's something seriously wrong in my head'* realisation a couple of times a day.

Hate when I find something really funny that I can't share with anyone because there's no one I know who will get it. It's either some very obscure reference that requires being chronically online to understand, or a topic that no one I know is interested in, like Pok√©mon.
