**Currently**

- Playing Pokemon Black Pearl Emerald.
- Redesigning and tweaking my website yet again.

**Planning**

- Javascript.
- Make another Pokemon rom hack.
- Read more ebooks.
- Check out other, more popular static site engines that I might switch this site to, because it will be much easier to find out how to implement something with a tool that most people use.

**Finished**

- Setting up a new SSD as my primary drive. Windows 11 is sluggish asf on an HDD.
- Switching to Microsoft Edge + uBo lite on Android. Kiwi hadn't been updated in a long time and Edge supports extentions now which makes it the perfect replacement.
- Switching and migrating all my notes from Notion to Upnote. Notion was becoming too sow and laggy.

**Paused**

- Dota
